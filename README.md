# Monetary-Policy-and-the-Wage-Inflation-Unemployment-Tradeoff

In an effort to be the change I want to see in the profession, I created an open repository in GitHub with the entire workflow from this project including all the codes, data, outputs, documentation, and tex files.

Folder [Text](https://github.com/RicardoGabriel/Monetary-Policy-and-the-Wage-Inflation---Unemployment-Tradeoff/tree/main/Text) presents the Tex version of the written article.

Folder [Output](https://github.com/RicardoGabriel/Monetary-Policy-and-the-Wage-Inflation---Unemployment-Tradeoff/tree/main/Output) stores all the final figures and tables produced and used in the final version of the article.

# Monetary Policy and the Wage Inflation Unemployment Tradeoff

In an effort to be the change I want to see in the profession, I created an open repository in GitHub with the entire workflow from this project including all the codes, data, outputs, documentation, and tex files.

Folder [Text](https://github.com/RicardoGabriel/Monetary-Policy-and-the-Wage-Inflation---Unemployment-Tradeoff/tree/main/Text) presents the Tex version of the written article and also the response to the editors and two referee reports from the first revision at the European Economic Review.

Folder [Data](https://github.com/RicardoGabriel/Monetary-Policy-and-the-Wage-Inflation---Unemployment-Tradeoff/tree/main/Data) stores all data.

Folder [Code](https://github.com/RicardoGabriel/Monetary-Policy-and-the-Wage-Inflation---Unemployment-Tradeoff/tree/main/Code) stores all Stata and MATLAB codes used to produce the figures and tables in the paper.

Folder [Output](https://github.com/RicardoGabriel/Monetary-Policy-and-the-Wage-Inflation---Unemployment-Tradeoff/tree/main/Output) stores all the final figures and tables produced and used in the final version of the article.
